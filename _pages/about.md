### Hi there, I'm Qi Zhao

I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I received dual bachelor's degrees (B.Sc. in Science and B.A. in Management) from Tiangong University in 2021. In the same year, I was granted the qualification for postgraduate recommendation without examination and began pursuing a master's degree at USTC in September 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Lan Zhang](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0706/c23235a460088/pagem.htm). In September 2023, I started my doctoral studies at USTC.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Technology under the supervision of my doctoral advisor [Prof. Xiang-Yang Li](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0806/c23235a460096/pagem.htm) and co-advisor [Prof. Qi Song](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2022/0220/c23236a546061/pagem.htm), while concurrently interning at Tencent YouTu Lab. My expected graduation date is in 2026.

### My research interests include:

- Knowledge Graph-enhanced Large Language Models for QA.
- Multi-turn Role-playing Dialogue.
- Efficient Reasoning in Reasoning Large Language Models.
- Knowledge-enhanced Pretrained Language Models.
